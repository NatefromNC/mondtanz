CAPTAINS LOG. _Starwaster_ operational daycycle 18361

They said space was there for the taking, billions of miles of unclaimed asteroids, moonlets, and planetoids just there for the taking. That humanity could never run out of space in the infinite universe. Well, I’ve got news for them: our solar system damn sure isn’t infinite. 

“Rob, you’re trying to be poetic again. Cut it out or it’s your funeral.” the captain’s wife- also the ship’s pilot and astrodynamicist- said.

—Dammit, Aino. Quit interrupting me while I’m pontificating. 

“This might be historical. Maybe. OK, screw it, it’s only for insurance. But you need to cut out the crap. Insurance only wants to know where you were, condition of your ship, etc.” lectured the petite Finn. They were all kind of new at this, and this was actually the first time Robert had bothered to log anything.

Fine. We’re in orbit around Ganymede. _Starwaster_ is operating as well as we can expect a fifty-year-old ship with a design lifetime of twelve years to. Our reactor is in the middle of a psychotic episode; the cooling pump broke down halfway through its duty cycle- meaning that it’s creating a bunch of waste heat and has nowhere to dump it. This is what the rest of us know as a nuclear meltdown. Normally, you’re supposed to SCRAM the reactor when this happens- which stops the nuclear reactor from working, and thus overheating…. or something. That’s not really my area of expertise- Alexei is our resident nukie. And from what he’s telling me, we can’t SCRAM it because the control rods are broken.

“So what’re we gonna do about this?” asked Aino wearily. “No way in hell we’re dying around this rock. “

“Depends. I’ll ask the twins, see if they’ve got anything.”

Robert sighed and keyed the intercom for the engineer’s hutch. The button had been pressed so many times over the years by _Starwaster_’s original crew that the paint had worn away to the point of illegibility, so somebody had just scribbled what the button did in Russian right under it. Luckily, knowing the language was a near-prerequisite for living in space these days.

“Alexei. Hey. You got anything else to stop us from going all Chernobyl?”

“One moment please,” the stocky engineer said. He was new to this operating-a-nuclear-reactor thing, and besides, he was more the type to make something up on the spot and spend his time with other pursuits than memorize the manuals. 

The engineer didn’t bother to mute the comms- all concerned could hear the fat-fingered Russian flipping madly through worn-out instruction manuals, trying to figure out which of the bafflingly organized dog-eared binders contained any pertinent information on the reactor.

“…. Ah. Found it. Apparently we’re supposed to inject a…. ‘fission poison’ into the core. Let us see… ‘boron’, it’s called.”

Alexei ran his index finger down the countless rows of switches and knobs.
“Boron injector… boron injector…. boron injector….. ah! there we go! And it is even full!”
He flipped the switch.
Nothing happened. The core temperature kept rising, slowly but steadily.
“Ctho za huy?!”
Alexei toggled the switch up and down a few times, just to be sure. 
“Problem, Alexei?” asked his twin brother, Anatoly, a similarly built mechanic and botanist.

“Da— mudak injector plumbing isn’t working.”

“Actually, the indicator might be stuck to full…”

“True. You check the plumbing, I’ll check the indicator.”

~~~
“You guys made any headway?” asked Robert a few hours later.

“Da. It turns out that the injector pump machinery is totally fine, we’re just out of boron.”

“Well crap. Anything else we can do?”

“I’m afraid not, short of ejecting the entire reactor assembly, leaving us dead in space until we pony up for somebody to produce another one for us. Total cost…. oh, fifteen billion dollars?”

“Jeez! Let’s keep that as a last resort.”

The captain took a beat to organize his thoughts, listening to the loud but somewhat comforting wheeze of the ventilator, and the intermittent whish-click of valves.

“Alright. How long do we have before this thing blows up in our faces?”

“Going by the rate the reactor’s heating up… about 48 hours.”

The commander sighed and clicked on the 1MC- the ship’s PA. 
“Listen up, people! As you know, we’ve got a nuclear reactor cooking us to death rather more faster than it should be. I’ve just been informed that we’ve got 48 hours to locate this magical potion called boron. Anything past that, and we’ll have to eject the reactor. Understand that since they don’t make replacement reactors, this is not an option. Give all your contacts a ring, see if they have any boron laying around. The closer they are the better.”
The captain keyed off the 1MC, then turned to the Finn.

“Alright, Aino, I need you to ask the lander computers what the Hohmann transfer times to the Galilean moons plus Callisto are. We need to know if we need to limit our search for boron to just Ganymede.”

“Sure thing.”
