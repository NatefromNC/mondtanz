Mondtanz ("moon dance" in German, mashed together into a compound word because Github asked me for a name) is
an attempt at creating a shared hard-SF universe, with an accent on peaceful expansion, exploration, world-building, 
and how people will live and die in space. There's a cyberpunk element to it as well, and exploring what happens when
a society on an inward migraton decides to also spread outward.

Acceptable Breaks from Reality:
There are six _Messenger_-class generation ships with an Alcubierre drive capable of 10_c_. Warp field is currently generated via the Casimir effect, but if anybody has a more up-to-date way of creating negative energy, feel free to find and replace. They're all on journeys to stars with viable exoplanets for colonization or extraterrestrial intelligence, and have enough nukes and cukes to last indefinitely (Think Charon with an Orion drive stuffed in the back and warp rings, and you'd be about right.). One's heading to the Kepler 63 system soon(TM), the rest are up for grabs.

That's it. Exotic matter is hella expensive. Everything else is STL ships with known technology. 

The most advanced garden-grade (i. e., protagonist-usable) ship would be a fusion rocket mothership with SCNTR powerplant. If your mothership has a TWR over 0.20, you're doing it wrong. The most advanced (i. e., baddie-usable, for given levels of baddie) ship would be a fusion-powered metallic hydrogen-burning monolithic lander-hab, but that's like Roving Fortress Adzam levels of self-interest and expense.
NO QV DRIVES UNTIL 2017, WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THEM.

Planets are still up for grabs as far as what corporations/nations own them. (Note: "Owns" in this case only means exclusive commercial and development rights for the property, any land claim MUST have permanent landing and refueling facilities.)
